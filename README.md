# Phishing-Email-Detection
With the increasing prevalence of online contacts in our daily lives, phishing attempts represent a serious threat to people, businesses, and cybersecurity in general. Phishing is a dishonest tactic that coerces people into divulging personal information, frequently resulting in identity theft, monetary loss, and privacy violations. By evaluating and categorizing dubious emails and texts, this project seeks to use machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) to fight phishing attacks. Our initiative aims to improve the capacity to identify and counteract phishing efforts by utilizing advanced text analysis and predictive modeling, ultimately making the internet a safer and more secure place. This initiative is a big step toward accomplishing the goal of developing creative and proactive approaches to phishing detection, which is essential given the constantly changing threat landscape.


Research Directed Questions-
1.	What techniques are required to improve the dataset?

   Extracting text from the  Dataset- Using TfidVectorizer , created a corpus of text which will be splitted into training and testing dataset later on.

   Data Cleaning: Address missing values and outliers, as these can negatively impact model performance. You can choose to impute missing values or remove data points.

   Labeling Accuracy: Ensure the accuracy of labels in the dataset. Mislabeling can lead to inaccurate model training.



2.	Data description- Phishing email dataset from the Association of Computational Linguistics.This dataset includes English email bodies with binary labels indicating whether each message is a real message or a phishing attempt. A dataset of 130424 features and 11928 items was created after the text was converted into numerical feature vectors using the word2vec neural network. The goal of the research was to develop a model that could determine from an email's body whether it was a genuine communication or a phishing effort.

3.	How can we minimize false positives and false negatives?

In the field of cybersecurity, reducing false positives and false negatives in a phishing detection model is essential. While false negatives, in which phishing emails are missed, present major security concerns, false positives, in which legitimate emails are inadvertently marked as phishing, have the potential to sabotage communication and undermine confidence. It takes a comprehensive strategy to find a balance. High-quality training data and carefully designed features that distinguish between phishing and authentic emails are the first steps in the process. The model's accuracy can be improved by using ensemble models, adjusting classification thresholds, and utilizing real-time and behavioral analysis techniques. Along with the development of feedback systems for model refinement, continuous learning and user education are essential elements. In the end, the search for a successful phishing detection model depends on a flexible, dynamic, and multidimensional approach that changes with the threat environment.
